    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This privacy policy applies to the OS360 app ("Application"), a professional gimbal control system consisting of an iOS application and ESP32 WiFi bridge, developed by Optical Support ("Service Provider").</p>

    <h2>Scope and Application</h2>

    <p>This Privacy Policy outlines our commitment to protecting your privacy when using the OS360 mobile application and its associated services. Currently, OS360 does not collect, store, or process any personal information. This policy serves to inform you of our data practices and will be updated should our approach to data handling change in the future.</p>

    <p>The OS360 Application is designed for professional cinema and broadcast environments, providing precise gimbal control and parameter tuning capabilities for compatible hardware systems. This policy applies to all users of the Application, regardless of location or method of access.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

    <p>Although OS360 does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data, the app requires certain permissions to function properly. Users will be prompted to grant permission for local network access, wireless data usage, and location services to enable communication with OS360 hardware over Wi-Fi.</p>

    <p>The app does not require user accounts, does not use analytics, and does not share any information with third parties. All app features operate locally on your device or via direct Wi-Fi connection to the OS360 ESP32 bridge. No data is sent to Optical Support or any external servers.</p>

    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>

    <p>OS360 stores the following data locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gimbal parameter profiles and configurations</li>
        <li>User preferences and settings</li>
        <li>Device connection history</li>
        <li>Automation scripts and sequences</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This data is stored using iOS Core Data and UserDefaults frameworks and remains on your device. It is not transmitted to external servers or shared with third parties.</p>

    <h2>Network Communication</h2>

    <p>OS360 communicates exclusively over local Wi-Fi networks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Establishes TCP connections to ESP32 bridge hardware on your gimbal</li>
        <li>Transmits gimbal control commands and parameter data</li>
        <li>Receives real-time feedback and status information</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All network communication occurs within your local network environment and does not involve internet connectivity or external servers.</p>

    <h2>Third Party Services</h2>

    <p>OS360 does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. The application operates independently without external dependencies for data processing or user tracking.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>OS360 does not knowingly collect any information from children. The app is intended for professional use in cinema and broadcast environments.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>

    <p>While no personal data is collected, the Service Provider is committed to ensuring the app operates securely and reliably. All communication with OS360 hardware is performed over local Wi-Fi using custom binary protocols with CRC16 validation to ensure data integrity.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>

    <p>Since OS360 does not collect personal data, there is no data retention policy applicable to personal information. Local device data (profiles, settings, etc.) is retained on your device until you choose to delete the application or reset your device.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. Continued use of the Application after changes constitutes acceptance of the new policy.</p>

    <p>This privacy policy is effective as of 2025-10-29</p>
